### Composition with Detailed Reporting

* Propositions are composable using all operations available in first-order logic.
* When propositions fail, care is taken to provide enough information to comprehend why, quickly.
  This is a goal even when the proposition is the composite of many underlying propositions of which, only a few failed.
* Individual propositions can written to provide specialised info about why they fail, when they fail.

##### Example
This property checks that each number in a list is even, divisible by 3 and divisible by 5:
```scala
val even = Prop.test[Int]("even", _ % 2 == 0)
val div3 = Prop.test[Int]("div3", _ % 3 == 0)
val div5 = Prop.test[Int]("div5", _ % 5 == 0)
val prop = (even & div3 & div5).forallF[List] rename "Example"
```
This is a sample failure report:
```
Property [Example] failed.

Input: [List(15, 30, 60, 25)].

Root causes:
  2 failed axioms, 2 causes of failure.
  ├─ even
  │  ├─ Invalid input [15]
  │  └─ Invalid input [25]
  └─ div3
     └─ Invalid input [25]

Failure tree:
  Example
  └─ (even ∧ div3 ∧ div5)
     ├─ even
     └─ div3
```

### Runtime Assertion

In cases where we can't encode constraints using types, we generally write property-based tests.
Just as the compiler cannot prove these constraints, nor can it prove that we've written data
generators that will cover all cases. Thus as an additional safety check I like to validate
the assumed laws at runtime using real data. I (may) also want these checks omitted from
production code so as not to impact performance. Nyaya covers these scenarios.


* Use the same code to validate real data at runtime, and test with random data in unit tests.
* Runtime validation can be removed by specifying a scalac flag `-Xelide-below`.

##### Example
```scala
object MyProps {
  val foo: Prop[Foo] = ...
}

case class Foo(a: Int, b: String) {
  import nyaya.prop._
  this assertSatisfies MyProps.foo
}
```

### Generating Random Data

Simply `import nyaya.gen.Gen` and follow the API.

Combinators are all in `Gen` instances and the companion object.

Examples:

|Type to generate|Constraints|Expression|
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `String` | None. | `Gen.string` |
| `String` | Length between 4 and 12. | `Gen.string(4 to 12)` |
| `String` | Exactly 6 chars, A-Za-z0-9. | `Gen.alphaNumeric.string(6)` |
| `List[Int]` | None.           | `Gen.int.list` |
| `List[Int]` | Non-empty.      | `Gen.int.list1` |
| `List[Int]` | Max 8 elements. | `Gen.int.list(0 to 8)` |
| `Set[Int]`  | Each element ≥ 0. | `Gen.positiveInt.set` |
| `Map[Int, Option[Boolean]]` | None.        | `Gen.int.mapTo(Gen.boolean.option)` |
| `Map[Int, Option[Boolean]]` | ≤ 4 entries. | `Gen.int.mapTo(Gen.boolean.option)(0 to 4)` |
| `Map[String, Set[Int]]` | ≤ 4 elements per set.<br>≤ 10 map entries. | `Gen.int.set(0 to 4).mapBy(Gen.string)(0 to 10)` |

Note: `Gen` does not contain a `.suchThat` or `.filter`.
Don't generate data just to throw it away. Instead, write an accurate generator.
There are better ways than throw-away-retry.

### Generating Random JSON

Add the `nyaya-gen-circe` module as a dependency and then:

```scala
import io.circe.Json
import nyaya.gen.circe.GenJson

// Generate JSON with a maximum depth of 4
val json: Json =
  GenJson(4).sample()
```

##### Example
Say we have these data types
```scala
  case class Id(value: Int)

  case class Blah(ids: Set[Id], prevCoord: Option[(Double, Double, Double)])
```
Generators for each are:
```scala
  val id: Gen[Id] =
    Gen.positiveInt map Id

   // Using for-comprehension
   val blah: Gen[Blah] =
     for {
       ids       <- id.set
       prevCoord <- Gen.double.triple.option
     } yield Blah(ids, prevCoord)

   // Quicker
   val blah: Gen[Blah] =
    Gen.apply2(Blah)(id.set, Gen.double.triple.option)
```

### Testing with Random Data (pt.1)

* Different settings for JVM/JS. By default…
  * JVM tests are large in quantity and data size, and they run in parallel.
  * JS tests are smaller in quantity and data size, and run on a single-thread.
* Settings can be configured per-test or per-module if required. (Here, implicits are used for the `Settings`.)
* A debug-mode is available in `Settings` to display verbose info about the testing and data-generation. It also has a nice little max line length so the output remains comprehensible. And it's in colour. Whoa!....

##### Example
```scala
val gen : Gen[A] = ...
val prop: Prop[A] = ...

import nyaya.test.PropTest._

gen mustSatisfy prop        // Method 1
prop mustBeSatisfiedBy gen  // Method 2
```

### Testing with Random Data (pt.2)

This is where things may start to differ from what you're used to...
What happens when your proposition needs a little extra data just for testing? Wouldn't that require type gymnastics
for composition? Yes. But there's another way...

When writing a suite of propositions to test behaviour, there are often many props with similar inputs. The strategy
thus far has been to create a context (class) in which an iteration of random data has been generated (supplied via
class constructor), and then test within that context.
So instead of composing `Prop[Set[A]]` with `Prop[(Set[A],A,A)]` (which needs two As just for testing),
you instead create a context class like `class SetTest[A](s: Set[A], a1: A, a2: A)` and within that
use `Eval` instead of `Prop`, the difference being that `Eval` is evaluated immediately and doesn't need input later.

`Eval` has all the same logic operations that `Prop` has; implication, negation, forall, etc.

A nice benefit of this approach is that your data generators do less work. If you're testing 2 string props:

1. `(s: String) => s.reverse.reverse == s`
2. `(a: String, b: String) => (a + b).length == a.length + b.length`

then you gain nothing by ensuring that the reverse test gets a string different than `a` or `b`. It's more efficient to generate two strings and pick one to use for the reverse test.

##### Example
See [MultimapTest.scala](../nyaya-test/src/test/scala/nyaya/util/MultimapTest.scala) for a real example.

### Proving

You can _prove_ a proposition by testing it with all possible, or legal values.
`Domain` exists for this purpose and should be used in place of `Gen`.

##### Example
```scala
// This is (the type of) proposition we want to prove
val prop: Prop[Option[Boolean]] = ...

// There are three possibilities: None, Some(false), Some(true)
// Establishing all possible values is easy
val domain: Prop[Option[Boolean]] =
  Domain.boolean.option

import nyaya.test.PropTest._

domain mustProve prop       // Method 1
prop mustBeProvedBy domain  // Method 2
```

### Uniqueness
**Validation** is the easy part. Just use `Prop.distinct`.
```scala
case class Thing(id: Int, name: String)
case class AllThings(timestamp: Long, things: List[Thing])

val p: Prop[AllThings] = Prop.distinct("thing IDs", (_: AllThings).things.map(_.id))
```

**Generation** is normally much harder but with Nyaya, hopefully you'll find it easy. I sure do!

There is a class called `Distinct` that will ensure generated data is unique, usually with just a few combinators. I'll introduce it first by showing a few examples, with an explanation after.

```scala
// Let's start with something trivial: uniqueness in a List[Int]
val d = Distinct.int.lift[List]
val g = Gen.int.list.map(d.run)

// How about people with unique names
case class Person(id: Long, name: String)
val g = Gen.apply2(Person)(Gen.long, Gen.string1)
val d = Distinct.str.contramap[Person](_.name, (person, newName) => person.copy(name = newName))
g map d.run

// The whole (a,b)=>a.copy(b=b) thing gets old after a while
// Let's use Monocle to create lenses!
@monocle.macros.Lenses
case class Person(id: Long, name: String)

// Now let's generate a List[Person] with unique ids and names
val personGen = Gen.apply2(Person)(Gen.long, Gen.string1)

val distinctId   = Distinct.long.at(Person.id)
val distinctName = Distinct.str.at(Person.name)
val d            = (distinctId * distinctName).lift[List]

val g: Gen[List[Person]] = personGen.list map d.run
```

It works by knowing how to provide a unique value when a duplicate is found, the behaviour of which is provided by `Distinct.Fixer`. Once a `Fixer` exists, it is then passed to a `Distinct` which is used for type navigation and composition.

Uniqueness doesn't have to be restricted to a single field; it can extend across multiple fields in multiple types.
This is an example:
```scala
// Say we have these types...
import monocle.macros.Lenses

case class Id(value: Long)

@Lenses
case class Donkey(id: Id, name: String)

@Lenses
case class Horse (id: Id, happy: Boolean)

@Lenses
case class Farm(ds: List[Donkey], hs: Vector[Horse])

// Now say we want to prevent duplicate IDs between the donkeys and horses in Farm
// No duplicate IDs in Farm is acheived thus:

val distinctId     = Distinct.flong.xmap(Id)(_.value).distinct
val distinctDonkey = distinctId.at(Donkey.id)
val distinctHorse  = distinctId.at(Horse.id)
val distinctFarm   = distinctDonkey.lift[List].at(Farm.ds) +
                     distinctHorse.lift[Vector].at(Farm.hs)

val farmGen : Gen[Farm] = ...
val farmGen2: Gen[Farm] = farmGen map distinctFarm.run
```

### Other validation
* Set membership tests. All give detailed info on failure.
  * `Prop.whitelist` - Test that all members are on a whitelist.
  * `Prop.blacklist` - Test that no members are on a blacklist.
  * `Prop.allPresent` - Test that no required items are missing.
* `CycleDetector` - Easily detect cycles in recursive data.
  * Directed graphs.
  * Undirected graphs.
