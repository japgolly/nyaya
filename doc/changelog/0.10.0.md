# 0.10.0

* Add support for Scala 3.0.0-RC3

* Drop support for Scala.JS 0.6

* Upgrade all deps
  (except Monocle which I'm leaving based on the old Scalaz-based 1.6.3 - eventually Scalaz will be removed as a dependency)

* If anyone was using `Baggy` (which is highly doubtful), it's been renamed to `SetLike` and redesigned to support
  implementations that require a `ClassTag`. This should've been reported by Scala 2 as a bug but it only surfaced
  when compiling with Scala 3.
